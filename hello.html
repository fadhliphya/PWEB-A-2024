    General Manager of Barunastra ITS 2024 I Made Vibra Dananjaya revealed that the 12th INAMARINE event became a potential event to strengthen collaboration with the maritime industry. This is because Barunastra returned to appear for the third time in the leading shipping exhibition in Asia. “Barunastra is the only research team among students to showcase our innovative work,” said the student who is familiarly called Vibra.

<p>Being a team with many innovations, Vibra explained that this year’s INAMARINE was also a showcase for their innovative work in the form of the Nala Proteus 0.2 autonomous ship. The ship has been installed with a sophisticated and proven system for completing ocean clean-up missions. Thanks to these advantages, Nala Proteus 0.2 has won various prestigious events, including the International Roboboat Competition (IRC) last February
